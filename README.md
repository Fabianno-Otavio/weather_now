<h1 align="center">Fabianno Ot√°vio - Weather Now</h1>

<h3 align="justify">
  This is a project that I started by myself to learn more about consuming API's, so it was a real challenge to me and I've learned a lot with this project.
  The way it works is: you just type the location you want to know the current weather, or mark the box to search for your current location. I've made all the
  validation to make sure no error accours, but if you find one, please contact me.
